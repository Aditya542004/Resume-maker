                  A resume is a brief summary of a person's work experience, skills, and education, typically limited to one or two pages. On the other hand, a Curriculum Vitae (CV) is a more comprehensive document that provides a detailed overview of academic and professional achievements, publications, presentations, and more. CVs are often longer than resumes.
